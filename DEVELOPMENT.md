## Documentation

Documentation is split into two parts.

### Autogenerated Docs

* Pdoc3 is used for automatically generating an API documentation from Docstrings.
* Generated data can be found in `docs`.
* Code to build docs can be found in `run.sh docs`.
* Automatically triggered on every commit to master branch.
* Elements starting with an underscore are excluded.

### Manual Docs

* Everything contained within `README.md`.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions are used. The only external secret required at the moment is
`PYPI_TOKEN` in [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).

On every push the [`commit.yml`](.github/workflows/commit.yml) is run. The
workflow covers testing, linting, auto formatting, and doc generation.

The release workflow has to be triggered manually. This workflow runs tests,
builds and publishes to PyPI and creates a GitHub release that contains the
relevant part of the changelog. The process for release looks like this:

1. Ensure that the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) is up-to-date.
2. Ensure that the version is up-to-date in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).
3. Run `release` workflow manually from GitHub UI.

Used helper functions are contained in [`run.sh`](run.sh).
